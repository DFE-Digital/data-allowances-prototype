  Sorry, that didn't work

%p.govuk-body-l
  We didn't recognise that link.

%p.govuk-body
  If you clicked on the link from an email, you could try copying the two special values from your email into here:

= form_for @sign_in_token_form, url: validate_manually_entered_sign_in_token_path, method: :get do |f|
  = f.govuk_text_field :token
  = f.govuk_text_field :identifier
  = f.govuk_submit

%p.govuk-body
  Or #{link_to 'send a new email', new_sign_in_token_path}
