  Improving children’s internet access

%p.govuk-body-l
  We know internet access supports remote education, as well as virtual meetings between children and their social workers. That’s why we’re providing laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers to disadvantaged families. (There’s more about this on #{link_to 'GOV.UK.', 'https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-help-with-technology-for-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19'})

%p.govuk-body-l
  We also know some children don’t have reliable internet access. That’s why we’re now acting to change this.

  How we’re improving children’s internet access

%p.govuk-body
  The Department for Education has teamed up with BT and mobile network operators to improve children’s internet access in two different ways:

%ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
  %li
    We’re giving them free access to BT wifi hotspots. BT will create a set of profiles that young people can activate through name/password combinations.
  %li
    For anyone who can’t connect to a BT hotspot, we plan to boost data allowances on their mobile devices so they can access the internet without incurring data charges.

%h2.govuk-heading-l
  Who can get help

%p.govuk-body
  Increased internet access is available to children from early years up to 16, and care leavers up to 25 if they:

  %li
    don’t have access to a #{link_to 'fixed broadband connection', 'https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/broadband-speeds/broadband-basics'}
  %li
    cannot afford the additional data needed to access educational resources or social care services

  Accessing BT hotspots

%p.govuk-body
  The Department for Education has allocated a number of BT hotspot profiles to trusts and local authorities.

%p.govuk-body
  Once trusts and local authorities confirm they want these, they’ll receive profile details which they can pass on to schools to distribute.

%p.govuk-body
  Schools should only distribute the profiles to eligible young people who have access to BT hotspots.

%p.govuk-body
  If trusts and local authorities think their initial allocation isn’t sufficient, they can request more.

%h2.govuk-heading-l
  There’s technical support

%p.govuk-body
  BT are offering technical support to young people using the hotspots.

%p.govuk-body
  Their free help desk is open from 8am until 8pm on 0800 587 9983.

%h2.govuk-heading-l
  For young people who can’t connect to BT hotspots

%p.govuk-body
  We want to support young people who can’t connect to a BT hotspot. One possible solution is increasing data allowances on young people’s mobile devices so they can access the internet without incurring data charges. There will be more information about this once we confirm our plans.
